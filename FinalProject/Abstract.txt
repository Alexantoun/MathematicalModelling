Steven is aware of a discrepency between two sensors that measure the adhesiveness of zone particles based on temperature, for the most part the
two sensors agree. The problem arises at higher temperatures it was noted that the Purple Air Aeroqual-S900 had its ppbv 
(parts per billion by volume which is the number of ozone particles per billion air particles)readings drop whereas the 49C read a greater ppbv.
Steven and I are planning of modelling the drop of correlation between the readings as the temperature rises and during what times. This model will provide a
industrial analysis and test of the S900.
