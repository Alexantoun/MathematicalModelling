Journal of the process between Steven Nixon and myself (Alex Antoun) 

Tuesday, 8th of March:
Started spitballing ideas of a research topic that we can model. Have come up with two potential 
candidates one being a kaleidoscope and the other the exploration of how particles stick to
surfaces based on the temperature. Both of us agreed to come up with an extra idea of the coming
Thursday. In one week we'll try to come up with a very bare bones proof of concept to test
our ability to pull this off

Thursday, 10th of March: 
	picked 3 ideas and will spend the weekend scrutinizing and coming up with a proof of 
concept to see if we can actually pull of our ideas. First Idea is the stickyness of an ozone 
particle based on the temperature of the atmosphere. Second idea is exploring famine of a nation 
suffering heavy sanctions with few trading partners and not too much sunlight. Finally a forest
fire simulation that we're keeping on the shelf for now as we know we coulb absolutely pull it off
